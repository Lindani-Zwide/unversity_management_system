- Student enrollment, update, and removal functionality
- Search and display student records
- Delete all student records
- XML data file for storing student records and user credentials
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Technical Details
- Built using Qt6 and C++20
- Uses QCryptographicHash for password hashing and security
- Utilizes C++ regex library for input validation
- Employs QSharedPointers for dynamic memory management
- XML data file for storing student records and user credentials
- Deployed using windeployqt (and equivalent tools on macOS and Linux) to create a standalone executable file

Deployment
The application is deployed as a standalone executable file that can be run on any machine (Windows, macOS, Linux) without requiring Qt or a C++ compiler to be installed.

Security Measures
- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 algorithm and stored securely in the XML data file
- Input validation and error handling to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

Future Development
- Additional features and functionality are planned for future releases
